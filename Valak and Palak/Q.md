Valak is tired of her 9 PM to 5 AM job of scaring people and now wants to try something new in her life (read afterlife).

She joins an n day workshop in a dance class, where her dance instructor Palak teaches her a new step with an integer difficulty value d everyday.

The difficulty value gets multiplied by an integer r each day. Suppose the difficulty on first day is d, it will be dr next day, and so on.

Your job is to find the sum of diffuculty values of the entire n day workshop, given the values of d and r.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer t, denoting the number of test cases. Subsequent t lines contain three integers, n,d and r.

Constraints

• 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5

• 1 ≤ n ≤ 8

• 1 ≤ d ≤ 100

• 1 ≤ r ≤ 8

Output Format

Print the sum of diffuculty values of the entire n day workshop, in a new line
