Kasukabe Defence Group led by Bo Chan is in XORland for their next misson.

On an old wall, they found the old problem of Exclusive or. On the wall, two integers a & c were written. The problem demanded an integer p such that a⊕p = c.

Given two integers a and c, find out p.

PS: ⊕ denotes the XOR operation, to get more understanding about it, read sample test cases.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer t, denoting the number of test cases. Subsequent t lines contain two integers, a and c.

Constraints

• 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5

• 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^5

• 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^5

Output Format

Print the value of p in a new line for each test case
